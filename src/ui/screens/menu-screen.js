          <p>You are governor. You have <strong>12 turns</strong> to keep the city alive.</p>

          <p><strong>Each turn:</strong> read the dispatch, resolve a policy decision, and manage your advisors. Crises hit on turns 4, 8, and 12 -- respond or pay the price.</p>

          <p><strong>Approval</strong> drops to 0% and your term ends in disgrace. Keep citizens on side, handle scandals quickly, and don't run out of budget.</p>

          <p><strong>Advisors</strong> have hidden agendas. Their trust decays every turn. Ignore their domain too long and they go absent -- or worse, betray you. If one betrays you, a full-screen alert fires and you must acknowledge it before continuing.</p>

          <p><strong>Scandals</strong> erupt randomly. Minor ones can be suppressed (costs budget) or accepted (costs approval). Career-ending scandals are existential -- one wrong move and it's over.</p>

          <p><strong>Bribes</strong> appear when an advisor's agenda is running hot. Pay them off to buy loyalty, or decline and watch them accelerate toward betrayal.</p>

          <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> varies by city: Easy cities are stable and well-funded. Hard and Extreme cities start with low approval, broken budgets, and advisors who are already plotting. War zones are survival mode.</p>

          <p><strong>20 cities</strong> available -- each with unique advisors (3-5 depending on city size), scandals, crises, and cultural voice. Some cities have special income mechanics: Cayman's offshore tax base pays regardless of approval; Gaza runs on international aid.</p>

          <p>End your term with <strong>65%+ approval</strong> to receive an invitation to govern again.</p>
