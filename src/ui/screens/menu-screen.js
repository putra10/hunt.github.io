        <div class="modal-body">
          <p><strong>JOB.</strong> You are governor. Survive <strong>12 turns</strong>. Approval hits 0% and you're recalled. How clean your hands stay is up to you.</p>

          <p><strong>EACH TURN.</strong> Read the dispatch, pick one of three answers to the day's problem — SAFE is expensive, BOLD is risky, CHAOS is cheap and unhinged. Undecided problems <strong>carry over and pile up</strong>; ignore one for 3 turns and it becomes a scandal on its own. End the term with a backlog and there's no invitation, whatever your numbers. Crises hit on turns <strong>4, 8 and 12</strong>; they can't be ignored at all.</p>

          <p><strong>ADVISORS.</strong> Each has trust (keep it fed or they check out) and a hidden agenda (at 80, they betray you). They argue their advice in chat, with reasons — based on what <em>they</em> value, and a restless advisor's recommendation may be designed to hurt you. Watch the agenda bar before you trust anyone. Ignore their advice and pay for it, and a smug "I told you so" lands in your messages the next morning — red badge and all.</p>

          <p><strong>BACK CHANNEL.</strong> In any advisor's chat: get closer (all the way to romance — loyal, useful, and one leaked photo from disaster), run a corrupt pact, threaten, leak dirt, or throw someone under the bus. One dirty move per turn. Lovers and crime partners are <strong>needy</strong> — most turns one of them wants something, and a red badge marks who's waiting on you.</p>

          <p><strong>SCANDALS.</strong> Suppress them with money, accept the hit, or manage the story with a response. Ignore one and it runs at full force tomorrow. Career-ending scandals offer only a 25% miracle — or resignation.</p>

          <p><strong>SCRUTINY.</strong> Every scandal and every scheme raises the press's attention: MURMURS &rarr; WATCHED &rarr; INVESTIGATED &rarr; UNDER SIEGE. High scrutiny makes everything leak faster; three turns under siege ends you. Stay clean to cool off — or address the nation, sacrifice a colleague, or pay to make files disappear.</p>

          <p><strong>BLACK MARKET.</strong> Some nights after your decision, dealers knock: bought approval, wiretaps, fixers, militia payoffs, or cash for pieces of your city. Every deal works. Every deal raises scrutiny. Every deal can go wrong at the printed odds.</p>

          <p><strong>MONEY.</strong> Taxes scale with approval. Deficits bleed approval every turn, and a broke, hated city riots. Contracts and emergency powers are your lifelines.</p>

          <p><strong>25 CITIES</strong>, five difficulty tiers — from stable and well-funded to war zones where the city is on fire before you arrive. Each has its own advisors, scandals, and voice.</p>

          <p>Finish at <strong>65%+ approval</strong> for the good ending. Finish at all for an honest one. The final report remembers everything — including what happened in the back rooms.</p>
