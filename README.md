# GOVERNED

> *Run the city. Hide the bodies. Smile for the cameras.*

**GOVERNED** is a browser-based political governance simulator. You are appointed governor of a city in crisis. Survive a 12-turn term — keep your approval above zero, manage scandals, balance the budget, and decide every turn how dirty your hands are willing to get.

## What It Is

A single-player strategy game where every decision has a cost. You govern one of **25 real cities** — from Singapore to Mogadishu, Guatemala City to Gaza — each with its own political culture, economic pressures, a cast of advisors with hidden agendas, and a public that has heard every promise before.

There are no right answers. SAFE is expensive, BOLD is risky, CHAOS is cheap and unhinged. The city remembers everything.

## Features

- **25 cities** across five difficulty tiers — Easy to War — each with unique crises, scandals, and advisor dynamics
- **Advisor back channel** — build trust, start affairs, run corrupt pacts, threaten, or sacrifice colleagues to save yourself
- **SCRUTINY system** — a rolling heat meter that remembers every dirty deal; five levels from QUIET to UNDER SIEGE
- **Black market** — six dealer types offer influence, cleanup, intelligence, and things you probably shouldn't buy
- **Problem backlog** — ignore decisions and they pile up; ignore them too long and the press writes the story for you
- **Scandal management** — suppress, accept, or manage the story; career-ending scandals offer only resignation or a 25% last stand
- **Full end-of-term report** — dirty hands, clean hands, backroom relations, and everything the city remembers

## Project Structure (Short)

```
governed/
├── src/
│   ├── data/cities/        ← 25 city JSON files
│   ├── engine/             ← Pure game logic (no DOM)
│   ├── ui/                 ← Screens and components
│   └── styles/             ← Vanilla CSS design system
├── Hardcoded things/       ← Generic problem pools, black market offers
├── tests/                  ← Vitest engine suite
└── docs/                   ← Built output (GitHub Pages)
```

The engine never touches the DOM. All state lives in `game-state.js`; all rendering reads from it. See [GOVERNED_Project_Structure.md](GOVERNED_Project_Structure.md) for the full breakdown.
